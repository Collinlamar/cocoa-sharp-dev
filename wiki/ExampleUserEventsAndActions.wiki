#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

=1.0 Purpose=
The objective of this page is for the reader to create a CocoaSharp Xcode project to demonstrate the following:

 * Creating a custom View
 * Draw a small square on the view.

 * Allow the user to move the square around the custom view via mouse dragging or keyboard control
 * Allow the user to specify the color of the square.
In addition, this example is also being used as a test case for the CocoaSharp library in order to insure it supports such trivial software scenarios. 

=2.0 Introduction=
This example is a port of a [http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/DragItemAround/listing5.html Objective-C] example developed by Apple for their [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaViewsGuide/SubclassingNSView/chapter_5_section_4.html View Programming] reference. This example is a companion

 * Mono 1.2 or later 
 * CocoaSharp 0.9 or later (I'd recommend getting the latest source and compiling)
 * Apple Developer Tools (Xcode and Interface Builder) installed. 
 * [CSharpPlugin] installed
