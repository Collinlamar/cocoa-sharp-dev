#summary Video tutorial showing a developer making their first CocoaSharp application

=1.0 Purpose=

The objective of this page is for the reader to create an CocoaSharp Xcode project that allow the user to:

 * Type a string in a TextField 
 * Click a 'Count' Button 
 * The application display the number of characters in the user-specified string

=2.0 Introduction=

The below video tutorial shows a developer making their first CocoaSharp application. Basic concepts are demostrated which include using the Xcode project template, editing a .nib file, control bindings, etc. A word to the C# WinForm developers. The Cocoa window library IS NOT WinForms. Right, wrong or indifferent, it is what it is. I personally am an WinForm developer as well and found it difficult at first to get use to "hard" separation from the GUI controls and the source code. However, after a short time I started to get use it.


This little project was inspired from one of the code exercises from "Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X" by Aaron Hillegass

 * Mono 1.2 or later 
 * CocoaSharp 0.9 or later (I'd recommend getting the latest source and compiling)
