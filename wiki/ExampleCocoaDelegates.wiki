#summary Cocoa Delegates Example
=1.0 Purpose=
The objective of this page is for the reader to create a CocoaSharp Xcode project to demonstrate the following:

 * Create a text box to enter the word that the SpeechSynthesizer will speak.
 * Create a button for starting the speech.
 * Create a button for stopping the speech
 * Listen to the SpeechSynthesizer delegate when it fires the DidFinishSpeaking event.
In addition, this example is also being used as a test case for the CocoaSharp library in order to insure it supports such trivial software scenarios. 

=2.0 Introduction=
This example is a port of an example found in the book "Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X" by Aaron Hillegass.


=3.0 System Requirements=
 * Mono 1.2 or later 
 * CocoaSharp 0.9 or later (I'd recommend getting the latest source and compiling)
 * Apple Developer Tools (Xcode and Interface Builder) installed. 
 * [CSharpPlugin] installed
