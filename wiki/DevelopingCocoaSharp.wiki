#summary Developing CocoaSharp applications on MacOS X

= Introduction =

CocoaSharp is aimed at .NET/Mono developers that want to allow their users to have a native Mac OS X application experience. CocoaSharp allows developers to call Cocoa APIs in native C# code using dot notation. Developing Cocoa# applications will be just like developing Mono application except that you are allowed to call Cocoa and Foundation APIs. 

Once your application has compiled (and the bugs are fixed) it will function like any other Cocoa application.
