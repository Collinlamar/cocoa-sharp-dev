#summary : How you can contribute to the Cocoa# project

! HOWTO: Contribute to Cocoa#

!!Getting the latest Cocoa#

Checkout the latest CocoaSharp from SVN: svn://svn.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/cocoa-sharp/

Make sure aclocal files can be found. You might need to do:
 export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/share/aclocal"

Then run:
 ./autogen.sh --prefix /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current

Afterwards run:
 make

This will build '''cocoa-sharp.dll''' in the '''./src/Cocoa/''' folder.


!!Contributing

Use "Mono coding style":http://www.mono-project.com/Coding_Guidelines exclusively.

Every patch needs to include a ""ChangeLog"" entry. See the CONTRIBUTING file for more info.
Classes, methods and properties need to be documented in '''./doc/en/''' in order for a patch to be accepted. See below.

!!!Contributing documentation

Do not use inline XML documentation. Cocoa# uses separate XML files for Monodoc documentation.

To generate stubs for anything new you've created, go to the '''./doc''' folder and run:
 make update
